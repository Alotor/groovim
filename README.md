## Groovy Syntax for VIM Editor

This plugin continues the job done by Alessio Pace in his VIM Groovy Syntax.

http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=945

The problem with the above plugin is that hasn't changed since 2004 and doesn't has the added syntax
features added in Groovy since then.

## Changes to the original plugin
* Added multiline strings
* Added regular expressions literals
* Added syntax colouring on classes
